-- YouTube Player --

This project is solely for my learning of full-stack development. It can store necessary data of videos from YouTube like their title or HTML code for embedding the video and display them.
The UI design is really just non-existent because I have wanted to first set up how professional devs style web pages.

-- Features till now:

1. Fetching the video data from the youtube API using the ids of videos and storing it in a local database using MYSQL.
2. Playlist CRUD functionality.
3. Very Basic Search feature using only string matching.   (Plans to update this later)

-- Features to add in the future:

1. Search results from the youtube API to avoid adding videos from their ids.
2. Sorting playlists and videos in those respective playlists.
3. Experimenting with OAuth and potentially adding some feature related to user data.
4. Designing with modern CSS techniques and tools.

Thats really about it. This is my second project and I hope you will share your opinion about my code quality and anything I can improve.

Cheers,
Prince
