>>> Columns:

id     videoId       html     title    

>>> Use the formula 'Delay(min) = 1440 / (10000 / Num of videos)' to get the delay needed to syncronize data with thr YouTube API (I dont get it - future me)

>>> Playlists:

id INT	name		data (JSON) TEXT 		'FUTURE IDEA: have a column for the order of the playlists'


>>> Have the addition and deletion of videos from playlists be by looping over arrays of ids in server.js
